System Clock
============

96Boards IVY5661 can be driven by an internal oscillator as well as the main
PLL clock. By default System clock is sourced by PLL clock at 416MHz, driven
by internal oscillator.

Serial Port
===========

On 96Boards IVY5661 Zephyr console output is assigned to USART0.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.
