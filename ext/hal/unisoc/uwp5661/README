The Unisoc SDKs provides device header files and driver libraries for the
Unisoc UWP5 SoCs.

In order to use UWP SDKs, drivers and applications need to

1. Set CONFIG_HAS_UWP566x=y in Kconfig
2. Include driver/include/uwp566x_hal.h

After above operations, all of the peripheral driver library functions will
be accessible.
